# Perceptron Model

this is part of the theory for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

dendrites (input)
nucleus 
axons (output)

input signal can come from a variety of sources, outputs something in an axon.

Perceptron is a mathematical model for the neuron as described above.

x1, x2 ... = inputs  
w1, w2 ... = weights (for inputs)  
b = bias  
f(x) = function  
y = output   


What if x1 or x2 is 0?  
Then the weights have no effect.  
^ To fix this issue we can add in a bias term, b. to the inputs.  
We assign each nueron a bias (b). But not b1, b2, rather b is added to 
all weights!  

hmmm if bi is different for each weight, how does it get determined?
