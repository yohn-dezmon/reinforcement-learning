# Neural Networks

A multi-layer perceptron model!  
Vertical layers of individual perceptrons.
Take their output and feed them as input into another vertical layer of perceptrons.  

feed-forward = uni-directional (input --> output, left to right).  
fully connected: every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer!  

input layer: first layer.
