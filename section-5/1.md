# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Reinforcement Learning vs. AI 


Artificial Intelligence is the largest domain of the above categories.  
Everything else is a subset of AI.  

ML:
- statistical techniques
- supervised (uses historical labeled data)
- unsupervised (uses historical unlabeled data)
- reinforcement learning --> system of agent, environment, rewards


DL (Artificial Neural Networks):
- can be used for any of the above ML categories...
- it is a specific algo within ML that can be applied to supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcment learning problems!
- combining DL with RL has led us to approximate artificially intelligent systems
